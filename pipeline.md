### **Yes! In Azure DevOps Pipelines, the structure follows this hierarchy:**
```
Pipeline â†’ Stages â†’ Jobs â†’ Steps (Tasks/Scripts)
```

---

## **âœ… Breakdown of Each Component**
| **Component** | **What It Represents?** | **Contains?** |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Pipeline** | The full YAML definition for CI/CD execution. | One or more **stages**. |
| **Stage** | A logical grouping of jobs (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy). | One or more **jobs**. |
| **Job** | A unit of work that runs on an agent (VM/container). | One or more **steps** (tasks/scripts). |
| **Step** | A single action within a job (e.g., `CopyFiles@2`, `script`). | **Tasks or scripts**. |

---

## **âœ… Example of a Full Pipeline Structure**
```yaml
stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: "Build Stage"
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        displayName: "Build the Application"
        steps:
          - task: UseDotNet@2  # A built-in task
            inputs:
              packageType: 'sdk'
              version: '6.x'

          - script: |
              echo "Building the project..."
              dotnet build
            displayName: "Run Build Script"

  - stage: Deploy
    displayName: "Deploy Stage"
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: DeployJob
        displayName: "Deploy the Application"
        steps:
          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: 'MyAzureServiceConnection'
              appName: 'MyApp'
              package: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/BuildArtifacts'
```

---

## **âœ… Explanation**
| **Component** | **Name** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Pipeline** | (Whole YAML) | The entire CI/CD pipeline |
| **Stage 1** | `Build` | Contains **one job** to build the app |
| **Job 1** | `BuildJob` | Executes steps related to building |
| **Step 1** | `UseDotNet@2` | Installs .NET SDK (a **task**) |
| **Step 2** | `script:` | Runs `dotnet build` |
| **Stage 2** | `Deploy` | Contains **one job** for deployment |
| **Job 2** | `DeployJob` | Runs **deployment steps** |
| **Step 3** | `AzureWebApp@1` | Deploys the app to Azure |

---

## **âœ… Key Takeaways**
- **A pipeline contains multiple stages** (`Build`, `Deploy`).
- **Each stage contains jobs** (e.g., `BuildJob`, `DeployJob`).
- **Each job contains steps**, which can be:
  - **Tasks** (e.g., `UseDotNet@2`, `AzureWebApp@1`).
  - **Scripts** (e.g., `script: echo "Hello"`).
- **Jobs in the same stage run in parallel by default** (unless `dependsOn` is set).


### **Azure DevOps Pipeline with Automatic Job Retries on Failure**  
This YAML pipeline demonstrates:  
- âœ… **Parallel jobs**  
- âœ… **Conditional execution (`succeeded()`, `failed()`)**  
- âœ… **Automatic job retries using `retryCount`**  
- âœ… **Line-by-line comments explaining each step**

### **ðŸ”¹ Pipeline YAML**
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main  # Run pipeline only when changes are pushed to the 'main' branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use an Ubuntu virtual machine for all jobs

stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: "Build Stage"
    jobs:
      - job: BuildApp
        displayName: "Build Application"
        timeoutInMinutes: 10  # Set a timeout to prevent infinite hangs
        retryCount: 2  # Retry up to 2 times if the job fails
        steps:
          - script: |
              echo "Building application..."
              dotnet build
            displayName: "Build Code"  # Run the build command

      - job: RunTests
        displayName: "Run Unit Tests"
        timeoutInMinutes: 10  # Set timeout to prevent infinite runs
        retryCount: 3  # Retry up to 3 times if the job fails
        dependsOn: BuildApp  # âœ… Ensures this job runs ONLY AFTER BuildApp completes
        steps:
          - script: |
              echo "Running tests..."
              dotnet test
            displayName: "Execute Unit Tests"  # Run unit tests

  - stage: Deploy
    displayName: "Deploy Stage"
    dependsOn: Build  # This stage runs only if the 'Build' stage succeeds
    condition: succeeded()  # Ensures deployment only runs if the Build stage is successful
    jobs:
      - job: DeployWebApp
        displayName: "Deploy Web App"
        timeoutInMinutes: 15  # Timeout to avoid long-running deployments
        retryCount: 2  # Retry if the deployment fails
        steps:
          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: 'MyAzureServiceConnection'  # Azure service connection name
              appName: 'MyApp'  # Name of the Azure Web App
              package: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/BuildArtifacts'  # Path to the build artifact
            displayName: "Deploy Web App to Azure"

      - job: DeployDatabase
        displayName: "Deploy Database"
        dependsOn: DeployWebApp  # This job runs only if 'DeployWebApp' completes successfully
        condition: succeeded()  # Ensures it only runs if DeployWebApp succeeds
        timeoutInMinutes: 10  # Limit database deployment duration
        retryCount: 3  # Retry up to 3 times if the database deployment fails
        steps:
          - script: |
              echo "Deploying database..."
              echo "Running migrations..."
            displayName: "Run Database Migrations"  # Simulated DB deployment

      - job: NotifySuccess
        displayName: "Notify Team of Success"
        dependsOn: [DeployWebApp, DeployDatabase]  # Runs after both jobs complete
        condition: succeeded()  # Runs only if all dependencies succeed
        steps:
          - script: echo "Deployment successful! Notifying team..."
            displayName: "Send Success Notification"  # Notify team on success

      - job: NotifyFailure
        displayName: "Notify Team of Failure"
        dependsOn: [DeployWebApp, DeployDatabase]  # Runs after both jobs
        condition: failed()  # Runs only if one of its dependencies fails
        steps:
          - script: echo "Deployment failed! Notifying team..."
            displayName: "Send Failure Notification"  # Notify team on failure
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Retries**
| **Job** | **Retries** | **When?** |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| `BuildApp` | **2 times** | If it fails, retries **2 more times** before failing completely |
| `RunTests` | **3 times** | If tests fail, retries **3 more times** before stopping |
| `DeployWebApp` | **2 times** | Retries **twice** in case of a failed deployment |
| `DeployDatabase` | **3 times** | Retries **3 times** if database migration fails |

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Additional Features**
âœ… **`retryCount`** â†’ Retries jobs automatically upon failure.  
âœ… **`timeoutInMinutes`** â†’ Prevents jobs from running indefinitely.  
âœ… **`dependsOn:`** â†’ Ensures ordered execution of deployment jobs.  
âœ… **`condition: succeeded()` & `condition: failed()`** â†’ Triggers success/failure notifications.  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ What Happens in Case of Failures?**
1. If **BuildApp fails**, it is retried **twice** before stopping.  
2. If **RunTests fail**, they are retried **three times** before marking the stage as failed.  
3. If **DeployWebApp fails**, it is retried **twice** before stopping.  
4. If **DeployDatabase fails**, it is retried **three times** before failing.  
5. If **DeployWebApp or DeployDatabase fail**, the `NotifyFailure` job **sends an alert**.  
6. If **everything succeeds**, the `NotifySuccess` job **sends a success notification**.  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways**
- âœ… **`retryCount` automatically retries failing jobs** instead of manually restarting pipelines.  
- âœ… **`timeoutInMinutes` prevents infinite hangs** (important for long-running processes).  
- âœ… **Failure notifications are automatically sent** if a deployment job fails.  
- âœ… **Efficient use of parallel execution** improves speed while keeping dependencies structured.  

### **Azure DevOps Pipeline with Push, PR, and Manual Execution**
This YAML pipeline will **automatically trigger on**:
- **Push events** (`trigger:`) â†’ Runs when changes are pushed to `main`.
- **Pull requests (PRs)** (`pr:`) â†’ Runs when a PR is opened or updated for `main`.
- **Manual execution** (No trigger needed) â†’ Can always be run manually via the Azure DevOps UI.

---

### **âœ… Full YAML Pipeline**
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main  # Runs when changes are pushed to 'main'

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - main  # Runs when a PR is created or updated targeting 'main'

```

---

### **âœ… How This Works**
| **Trigger Type** | **Keyword Used** | **When Does It Run?** |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Push (default CI trigger)** | `trigger:` | Runs when code is pushed to `main` |
| **Pull Request (PR trigger)** | `pr:` | Runs when a PR is created or updated for `main` |
| **Manual Execution** | No keyword needed | Always available in Azure DevOps UI |

---

### **Should Tests Run in a Separate Stage? (Best Practices)**
Yes! **Best practices recommend running tests in a separate stage** rather than in the same `Build` stage.  

### **Why?**
âœ… **Stages run sequentially, ensuring the build is complete before testing starts.**  
âœ… **Better pipeline visualization** (easier to see if the build or tests failed).  
âœ… **Faster parallel execution** (multiple test jobs can run independently).  
âœ… **Allows test failures to stop deployment without affecting the build stage.**  

---

## **âœ… Improved Pipeline: Separate Build & Test Stages**
```yaml
stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: "Build Stage"
    jobs:
      - job: BuildApp
        displayName: "Build Application"
        timeoutInMinutes: 10
        retryCount: 2
        steps:
          - script: |
              echo "Building application..."
              dotnet build
            displayName: "Build Code"

  - stage: Test
    displayName: "Test Stage"
    dependsOn: Build  # âœ… Ensures tests run ONLY after build completes
    jobs:
      - job: RunTests
        displayName: "Run Unit Tests"
        timeoutInMinutes: 10
        retryCount: 3
        steps:
          - script: |
              echo "Running tests..."
              dotnet test
            displayName: "Execute Unit Tests"
```

---

### **ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Improved in This Version?**
| **Feature** | **Old Version (Single Stage)** | **New Version (Separate Stages)** |
|------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Build & Test Order** | Jobs ran in parallel, risking tests starting before build. | âœ… Tests wait for the build to complete (`dependsOn: Build`). |
| **Pipeline Visualization** | Build & test were in one stage, making failures harder to track. | âœ… Separate `Build` and `Test` stages for clearer debugging. |
| **Failure Handling** | If the build failed, the test job still appeared as part of `Build`. | âœ… Test failures clearly appear in the `Test` stage. |
| **Performance** | Jobs shared the same agent in one stage. | âœ… Test jobs can run on different agents in parallel. |

---

### **ðŸ’¡ When to Keep Tests in the Same Stage?**
- **For quick unit tests** that donâ€™t need a separate stage.
- **For fast feedback loops** in CI pipelines where a separate stage adds overhead.
- **For lightweight validation** that runs on the same agent as the build.
